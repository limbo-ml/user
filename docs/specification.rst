Limbo Data Format
=================

We created the Limbo Data Format to organize and annotate the hybrid synthetic
training data that we create for our machine learning research.

You may be wondering why we created yet another format for storing computer
vision training data ... why not COCO or VOC?  We seriously considered these
and other formats for our work, but found that they all lacked features that
we needed, including the following:

* Multiple images per sample - our synthetic data includes both visible spectrum and depth information, and existing formats didn't provide a way to logically group together related images for this purpose.
* Antialiased mattes - mattes generated by our synthetic workflow include subpixel coverage information, while existing formats assume simple boolean all-or-nothing coverage.
* High-dynamic-range images - our synthetic workflow generates high quality HDR pixels, instead of the highly-quantized integer pixels of existing images.

Many of these features are stored in a highly compressed form, in file formats
that aren't widely used in the machine learning community.  The :ref:`software`
provides an API to simplify extracting just the information you need to use
:ref:`specification` information in your research.  In the sections that
follow, we will describe how the data is organized.

Terminology
-----------

Here are some terms that we use throughout the documentation, and what we mean
when we use them.

Annotation
    Generic term for any ground-truth applied to a *sample*; *bounding boxes*,
    *contours*, and *tags* are specific types of annotation.

Bounding Box
    Specific type of *annotation* that applies a *category* to a rectangular
    region of an image; the ground truth for *object detection*.

Category
	An arbitrary (but not empty) string label.

Contour
    Specific type of *annotation* that applies a *category* to an arbitrary
    region of an image, bounded by a set of one-or-more 2D polygons; the ground
    truth for *object segmentation*.

Dataset
    A dataset is a collection of *samples*.

Metadata
    The metadata for a *sample* is an arbitrary JSON data structure which
    contains provenance, *annotations*, and references to the sample
    images.

Sample
    We refer to each of our observations as a *sample*.  Every sample includes
    arbitrary *metadata*, which may include *annotations*, and a collection of
    zero-to-many images.

Tag
    Specific type of *annotation* that applies a *category* to an entire image;
    the ground truth for *classification*.

Specification
-------------

A Limbo dataset is a collection of metadata files in JSON format, each
containing the metadata for a single sample.  The metadata filenames *must* end
with ".json", but the remainder of the filename is arbitrary.  Metadata files
can be organized in arbitrary hierarchies on disk, but those hierachies carry
no meaning and the :ref:`software` will treat the dataset as a flat collection
of samples.

For each sample, image data is stored in separate files.  The image filenames
are arbitrary, but each image file *must* be located in the same directory as
the corresponding metadata file.

We strongly urge you to use the :ref:`software` to manipulate Limbo data, as it
greatly simplifies most data-wrangling tasks and is guaranteed to be up-to-date.

Photograph Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a real-world photograph, the simplest useful metadata file might look like the following::

    {
      "image": {
        "content-type": "image/jpeg",
        "filename": "1234a.jpg",
        "res": [
          800,
          638
        ]
      }
    }
    
... in this case, the file references a single image (1234a.jpg) in JPEG format (image/jpg) with resolution 800×638, and the image doesn't include any annotations. 

Whenever possible, real-world photos should include provenance information::

    {
      "image": {
        "content-type": "image/jpeg",
        "filename": "image_0000.jpg",
        "res": [
          800,
          638
        ]
      },
      "provenance": {
        "copyright": "2020 U.S. Department Of Stuff",
        "license": "U.S. Government Works",
        "license-uri": "https://www.usa.gov/government-works",
        "uri": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/departmentofstuff/1234a.jpg"
      }
    }
    
Note that there are provisions to store copyright and license information, along with the URI to the complete text of the license, and the URI to the original source of the image.  All of these fields are optional and might be missing.

Metadata will also include annotations when available.  The optional annotations field contains a flat list of annotations that apply to the image.  For example, the image may be *tagged* to provide ground truth for *classification*::

    {
      "annotations": [
        { "category": "photograph" },
        { "category": "daytime" },
        { "category": "30B" }
      ],
      "image": {
        "content-type": "image/jpeg",
        "filename": "image_0000.jpg",
        "res": [
          800,
          638
        ]
      },
      "provenance": {
        "copyright": "2020 U.S. Department Of Stuff",
        "license": "U.S. Government Works",
        "license-uri": "https://www.usa.gov/government-works",
        "uri": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/departmentofstuff/1234a.jpg"
      }
    }
    
Similarly, the annotations could include *bounding boxes* for *object detection*::

    {
      "annotations": [
        { "category": "photograph" },
        { "category": "daytime" },
        { "category": "30B" },
        {
          "bbox": [
            30.092927932739258,
            152.92666625976562,
            198.16666984558105,
            116.9666748046875
          ],
          "bbox_mode": "XYWH_ABS",
          "category": "30B"
        }
      ],
      "image": {
        "content-type": "image/jpeg",
        "filename": "image_0000.jpg",
        "res": [
          800,
          638
        ]
      },
      "provenance": {
        "copyright": "2020 U.S. Department Of Stuff",
        "license": "U.S. Government Works",
        "license-uri": "https://www.usa.gov/government-works",
        "uri": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/departmentofstuff/1234a.jpg"
      }
    }

Note that each bounding box annotation contains the extents of the box, plus the *category*.  The required *bbox_mode* field explicitly indicates how to interpret the box extent values.  In this case, *XHWH_ABS* indicates that the extents are defined using the top-left corner of the box, plus the width and height respectively.  All values are measured in absolute (pixel) units, from the top-left corner of the image.

Finally, annotations can also include *contours* for *object segmentation*::

    {
      "annotations": [
        { "category": "photograph" },
        { "category": "daytime" },
        { "category": "30B" },
        {
          "bbox": [
            30.092927932739258,
            152.92666625976562,
            198.16666984558105,
            116.9666748046875
          ],
          "bbox_mode": "XYWH_ABS",
          "category": "30B"
        },
        {
          "category": "30B",
          "contour_mode": "XY_ABS",
          "contours": [
            [
              [
                582.0,
                719.3859110474486
              ],
              [
                582.4620157651706,
                719.0
              ],
              # Coordinates elided for clarity
              [
                645.226868058932,
                627.0
              ]
            ]
          ]
        }
      ],
      "image": {
        "content-type": "image/jpeg",
        "filename": "image_0000.jpg",
        "res": [
          800,
          638
        ]
      },
      "provenance": {
        "copyright": "2020 U.S. Department Of Stuff",
        "license": "U.S. Government Works",
        "license-uri": "https://www.usa.gov/government-works",
        "uri": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/departmentofstuff/1234a.jpg"
      }
    }

Note that the *contours* field is a list of contours, where each contour is a list of coordinates, and each coordinate is a pair of values.  The required *contours_mode* field indicates that the coordinates are all absolute (pixel) values relative to the top-left corner of the image (XY_ABS).

Synthetic Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata for synthetic samples generated using CGI can contain any subset of the above, plus additional synthetic-specific fields.  The simplest possible synthetic sample metadata would be the following::

    {
      "synthetic": {
        "cryptomatte": {
          "content-type": "image/x-exr",
          "filename": "cryptomatte_0000000.cryptomatte.exr",
          "manifest": [
            "30B/0"
          ],
          "res": [
            720,
            720
          ]
        },
        "image": {
          "content-type": "image/x-exr",
          "filename": "image_0000000.exr",
          "res": [
            720,
            720
          ]
        }
      }
    }

Note that this sample includes an image (image_0000000.exr) in OpenEXR format (image/x-exr) that is 720×720, plus a *cryptomatte* (cryptomatte_0000000.cryptomatte.exr), also in OpenEXR format (image/x-exr) that is also 720×720.

The OpenEXR file format is a high-quality multi-channel image file format widely used in films, television, and special effects.  It can store high-dynamic-range (HDR) images and supplemental information not supported in other file formats.  For the :ref:`data`, the *image* file reference contains the original synthetic visible-wavelength HDR image, plus a corresponding Z-channel depth image suitable for use training models to make predictions on LIDAR information (see :ref:`depth`).

A cryptomatte is an OpenEXR file used to store high quality matte (or mask) information in an extremely efficient, highly compressed form.  For the :ref:`data`, the *cryptomatte* file reference contains image masks for every individual class instance in a single file, which can run to thousands of instances in some of the later campaigns.

Note that the *cryptomatte* field also contains a *manifest* field, which lists the label for every class instance that might be included in the file.  These labels are the keys for retrieving image masks for individual class instances.

This metadata file would be typical of a just-rendered synthetic sample; you're unlikely to encounter a metadata file this simple in the :ref:`data`, because we extract commonly-used metadata from the image and cryptomatte to give end-users a better out-of-box experience.  In particular, our metadata will always contain the visible-wavelength image as a PNG file for convenence::

    {
      "image": {
        "content-type": "image/png",
        "filename": "image_0000000.png",
        "res": [
          720,
          720
        ]
      },
      "synthetic": {
        "cryptomatte": {
          "content-type": "image/x-exr",
          "filename": "cryptomatte_0000000.cryptomatte.exr",
          "manifest": [
            "30B/0"
          ],
          "res": [
            720,
            720
          ]
        },
        "image": {
          "content-type": "image/x-exr",
          "filename": "image_0000000.exr",
          "res": [
            720,
            720
          ]
        }
      }
    }

... note the distinction between the *synthetic.image* field and the top-level *image* field, which is intended for general-purpose training of typical machine learning algorithms.  Users who are interested in training models using HDR and/or depth data can retrieve it directly from the OpenEXR file using the :ref:`software`, or other tools of their choosing.

We also automatically extract *contour* and *bounding-box* annotations for each sample, which we will not show again here.  Again, this is a convenience for typical present-day training tasks, advanced users who wish to train models using mask images instead of bounding boxes or contours can extract them directly from the cryptomatte file using the :ref:`software`.

A final piece of synthetic-image-particular information that may be included in sample metadata is the *parameters* field, which will include parameters used to generate the synthetic image.  For example::

    {
      "image": {
        "content-type": "image/png",
        "filename": "image_0000000.png",
        "res": [
          720,
          720
        ]
      },
      "synthetic": {
        "cryptomatte": {
          "content-type": "image/x-exr",
          "filename": "cryptomatte_0000000.cryptomatte.exr",
          "manifest": [
            "30B/0"
          ],
          "res": [
            720,
            720
          ]
        },
        "image": {
          "content-type": "image/x-exr",
          "filename": "image_0000000.exr",
          "res": [
            720,
            720
          ]
        },
        "parameters": {
          "/background/env_map": "driving_school_8k",
          "/camera/focal": 66.58746224652447,
          "/camera/orientation": [
            5.424789345191059,
            -151.62201181447,
            0.7936692623506559
          ],
          "/camera/position": [
            -3.428114175796509,
            2.1293375492095947,
            -9.065103530883789
          ],
          "/cylinder/material": "white",
          "/cylinder/variant": 2
        }
      }
    }

The parameters will include scene-specific information that may be of interest for more unusual experiments, such as predicting the style of cylinder in a scene, trying to infer the focal length of the camera, or predicting whether a scene is interior or exterior, day or night.
