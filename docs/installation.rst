Installation
============

Using Pip
---------

If your package manager doesn't support Limbo, or doesn't have the latest
version, your next option should be Python setup tools like `pip`.  You can
always install the latest stable version of Limbo and its required
dependencies using::

    $ pip install limbo-ml

... following that, you'll be able to use all of Limbo's features.

.. _From Source:

From Source
-----------

Finally, if you want to work with the latest, bleeding-edge Limbo goodness,
you can install it using the source code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/limbo-ml/limbo-ml.git
    $ cd limbo-ml
    $ sudo python setup.py install

The setup script installs Limbo's required dependencies and copies Limbo into
your Python site-packages directory, ready to go.
