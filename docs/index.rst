Welcome to Limbo!
=================

The Limbo project provides three things:

:ref:`data` is a growing collection (~1000000 images and counting) of synthetic
computer vision training data created for our research.  If you're a computer
vision researcher interested in training models on synthetic data, we encourage
you to take a look!

:ref:`specification` is the specification for how that data is stored.  If
you're creating synthetic image data for research, we encourage you to consider
adopting the same specification, and welcome feedback on how to improve it.

:ref:`software` is a collection of Python-based tools for managing data in
:ref:`specification`.  Whether you're using our :ref:`data` or creating your
own, these tools will simplify your work.
