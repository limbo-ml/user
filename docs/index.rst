Welcome to Limbo!
=================

The Limbo project provides three things:

:ref:`data` is a growing collection (400000 images and counting) of synthetic
computer vision training data created for our research.  If you're a computer
vision researcher interested in training models on synthetic data, we encourage
you to request a copy!

:ref:`specification` is the specification for how that data is stored.  If
you're creating synthetic image data for research, we encourage you to consider
adopting the same specification, and welcome your feedback!

:ref:`software` is a collection of Python-based tools for managing data in
:ref:`specification`.  Whether you're using our :ref:`data` or creating your
own, these tools will simplify your work.
